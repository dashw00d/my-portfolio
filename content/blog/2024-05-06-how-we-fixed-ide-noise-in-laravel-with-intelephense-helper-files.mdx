## The Annoying Lie Your IDE Tells You

You’re deep in the zone—building a slick new feature in Laravel, maybe wiring up a Livewire component or chaining a few Eloquent queries through a Facade. Then it happens: that red squiggly under `Auth::check()` or `Route::redirect()`. Your heart skips. Did I break something? You run the tests—green. You load the page—works perfectly. But the IDE won’t let it go. It insists there’s an error… that doesn’t exist.

That’s been my reality lately in the AustinsElite codebase (Laravel 12, not Next.js—turns out we had some outdated labels floating around). Despite Laravel’s magic, tools like Intelephense in VSCode often choke on Facades and Livewire components, flagging perfectly valid code as "undefined" or "non-static method called statically." It’s not a bug in Laravel—it’s a gap in static analysis. And it wastes time.

But after a few too many false alarms during a sprint of backend refinements, I decided to fix it once and for all.

## Building a Bridge for Intelephense

The key insight? Intelephense can’t always follow Laravel’s dynamic loading patterns. Facades like `Cache`, `Mail`, or `Storage` are resolved at runtime via service container magic. Livewire components are registered through macros and PHP DSLs that static analyzers can’t fully trace. So we help it—with a helper file.

We created `ide-helper.php` in the root of the project, outside the autoload chain (so it never hits production), filled with class stubs that mirror Laravel’s behavior. These aren’t implementations—just enough structure to satisfy the IDE’s need for certainty.

Here’s a snippet of what we added:

```php
<?php

// Fix Facade false errors
class Auth extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth {}
class Cache extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Cache {}
class Mail extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail {}
class Storage extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Storage {}
class Route extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route {}

class View extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\View {}

class App extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\App {}

class Log extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log {}

class DB extends \Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB {}
```

This tells Intelephense: "Yes, `Auth` is a real class. Yes, it supports static methods. No, you don’t need to panic."

We did the same for Livewire components. Previously, references like `@livewire('user-profile')` were flagged as undefined because Intelephense couldn’t resolve the component class from the string. The fix? Ensure every Livewire component is properly namespaced and imported—and then add a stub for it in the helper:

```php
// Livewire component stubs
class LivewireUserProfile extends \Livewire\Component {}
\Livewire\component('user-profile', LivewireUserProfile::class);
```

Now autocomplete works, and those red squigglies vanish.

## Import Paths and the Final Piece of the Puzzle

One sneaky issue remained: even with the helper file, some static analysis errors persisted. Turns out, a few Livewire components were being referenced using relative or incorrect namespaces in the views, like `@livewire('components/user-profile')` instead of the registered alias `user-profile`.

A quick audit of the Blade templates—guided by actual runtime behavior—revealed mismatched paths. We corrected them to match the canonical component names registered in `livewire.php` config, and updated the helper file accordingly.

The final step? Add the helper to `.vscode/settings.json` so Intelephense picks it up:

```json
{
  "intelephense.environment.includePaths": [
    "./"
  ]
}
```

Now, every dev on the project gets consistent, accurate autocomplete and error highlighting—without false positives.

This wasn’t a framework upgrade or a toolchain overhaul. Just a small, surgical fix. But the difference in developer flow is massive. No more second-guessing the IDE. No more tabbing to the browser just to confirm something works. We trust the code again.

And honestly? That’s worth the 20 minutes it took to set up.
