## The Quote Form That Almost Worked Perfectly

At AustinsElite, our quote request form is the front door to new client conversations. It’s a critical touchpoint—simple, clean, and built to convert. The frontend lives in a modern Blade template powered by Laravel 12, styled with Tailwind CSS, and backed by a custom mail handler. Everything *looked* solid. Submissions appeared to go through. Success messages popped up. But then we got the message: "We haven’t received your quote emails."

No errors. No logs. Just silence.

That’s the worst kind of bug.

## The Silent Mail Class Mismatch

Our first clue came from a user reporting a missing quote submission. I checked the logs—nothing. No failed jobs, no exceptions. The form submitted successfully, returned a 200, and redirected as expected. But the email never arrived.

I dug into the controller handling the form:

```php
Mail::to($email)->send(new QuoteRequestMail($data));
```

`QuoteRequestMail`—that class existed. It was in `app/Mail/QuoteRequestMail.php`. But something felt off. I opened it and compared it to our working `ContactMail` class. Then I saw it: a namespace mismatch.

The controller was calling:

```php
use App\Mail\QuoteRequestMail;
```

But the actual file was saved as `QuoteRequestMail.php`, while the class inside was named `class QuoteMail`. Classic mismatch. PHP didn’t complain because the autoloader found *a* class in the file—but it wasn’t the one we were calling.

So `new QuoteRequestMail($data)` was throwing a `Class 'App\Mail\QuoteRequestMail' not found` error—but because we weren’t wrapping the `Mail::send()` in a try-catch and logging failures, it failed silently. No notification. No trace.

The fix was simple:

```php
// Rename the class in the file
class QuoteRequestMail extends Mailable
```

And add error handling:

```php
try {
    Mail::to($email)->send(new QuoteRequestMail($data));
} catch (Exception $e) {
    \Log::error('Quote email failed: ' . $e->getMessage());
}
```

Suddenly, the emails started flowing. And if they fail again, we’ll know.

## Tailwind to the Rescue on Mobile

While debugging the backend, I noticed something else: on mobile, the footer hero section was smashed into the content. On desktop, it looked great—generous padding, clean separation. But on iPhone, the margin collapsed.

The Blade template used:

```blade
<div class="mt-20 sm:mt-16 md:mt-20">
```

Looks fine, right? But here’s the catch: `sm:` applies at 640px, which is *portrait* mobile. So on smaller screens, it was using `mt-16`, but our design needed `mt-8` for mobile to avoid visual clutter.

I adjusted the classes:

```blade
<div class="mt-20 sm:mt-8 md:mt-16">
```

Now, mobile gets a tighter margin, tablet scales up, and desktop keeps the full breathability. I tested across devices using Chrome DevTools and confirmed the fix.

What I love about Tailwind is that it makes responsive tweaks *visible* in the markup. No digging through CSS files. No mystery overrides. Just classes that tell you exactly what’s happening—and when.

## Lessons from the Trenches

This two-part bug taught me a few hard lessons:

1. **Silent failures are deadly.** Always wrap external interactions—email, APIs, file writes—in try-catch blocks and log the hell out of them. A 200 response doesn’t mean success.

2. **Class name ≠ file name ≠ class usage.** PHP’s autoloader is forgiving, but that forgiveness hides bugs. Use static analysis tools like PHPStan or Laravel Pint to catch mismatches early.

3. **Responsive design isn’t optional.** Test on real devices, not just emulators. Tailwind’s utility-first approach makes it easy to tweak, but you still have to *look*.

4. **Blade and Tailwind are a powerful combo**—but only if you respect the details. A single misplaced class can break the experience for half your users.

At the end of the day, our quote form now works as intended: submissions go through, emails get sent, and mobile users see a clean, intentional layout. No magic—just attention to detail.

If you’re building forms in Laravel, don’t assume success just because the frontend behaves. Check the backend. Check the logs. And always, *always* test on mobile.
