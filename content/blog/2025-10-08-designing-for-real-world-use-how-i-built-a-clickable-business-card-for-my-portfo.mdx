## Why a Business Card Belongs on a Developer’s Portfolio

Most developers treat their portfolio as a static resume—a place to list projects and skills. But I wanted mine to be *usable*. When someone lands on my site, whether it’s a recruiter, collaborator, or curious peer, I want them to be able to connect with me—fast.

That’s why I added a clickable business card component. It’s not flashy, but it’s functional: a compact, self-contained block with my name, role, contact info, and social links—designed to work everywhere. No downloads, no friction. Just click, copy, or save.

This small addition reflects a bigger shift in how I approach UI: not as decoration, but as utility. With systems like HomeForged and ForgeKit pushing toward modular, reusable components, I saw an opportunity to apply those principles at the smallest scale.

## Building the Layout: Flexbox, Responsiveness, and Print

The card had to look good and work well across devices—desktop, mobile, and even when printed. I started with a clean HTML structure:

```html
<article class="business-card">
  <h2>Ryan Dashwood</h2>
  <p>Frontend Developer & UI Engineer</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="mailto:ryan@example.com">ryan@example.com</a></li>
    <li><a href="tel:+1234567890">+1 (234) 567-890</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/ryandas">GitHub</a></li>
  </ul>
</article>
```

Using `<article>` makes the card a standalone semantic unit—important for both SEO and screen readers. The `<h2>` gives it proper document hierarchy, and each contact method is a list item with a meaningful link.

For layout, I leaned on Flexbox. A vertical stack on mobile, horizontal on desktop—simple, predictable, and easy to maintain.

```css
.business-card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 8px;
  max-width: 400px;
}

@media (min-width: 600px) {
  .business-card {
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
```

I also added print-specific styles so the card looks clean on paper—removing borders, adjusting colors for ink efficiency, and ensuring links are visible.

```css
@media print {
  .business-card {
    border: none;
    background: white;
    color: black;
  }
  .business-card a {
    color: black;
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
}
```

It’s a small touch, but it matters. Someone might print this to share in a meeting.

## Accessibility: More Than Just Keyboard Navigation

A component is only as good as its accessibility. I tested early with keyboard navigation—tabbing through links, ensuring focus states were visible—and fixed a few subtle issues, like inconsistent tab order and missing `:focus-visible` styles.

But I went further. I tested with VoiceOver and NVDA to confirm screen readers announced the card as a cohesive unit with proper context. The `<article>` role helped, but I also added `aria-label` to links where the text wasn’t descriptive enough (e.g., "GitHub" became "GitHub profile, external link").

I also made sure interactive elements had sufficient contrast and tap targets—especially on mobile. No one should struggle to tap an email link on a small screen.

One lesson: accessibility isn’t a checklist. It’s a mindset. When I caught a contrast ratio issue on the phone link (barely under WCAG AA), I didn’t just tweak the color—I questioned why I was using a subtle gray in the first place. Now it’s a clear, readable blue.

This attention to detail came from earlier fixes, like cleaning up footer links across the portfolio. Consistency isn’t just visual—it’s behavioral. If one link works a certain way, users expect others to follow.

## Small Component, Big Impact

The business card is a tiny part of my portfolio, but it represents a bigger philosophy: design for real use. Not for Dribbble likes or code golf, but for the person on a slow connection, the recruiter in a hurry, or the designer printing it out.

It’s built with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and tested with real assistive tools. It’s not perfect—but it’s usable, today. And that’s what matters.

If you’re building your own site, ask: what’s the one thing someone would want to *do* after landing? Make that action effortless. Even if it’s just sending an email.
