## Two Bumps Before Coffee

It’s 9:17 AM. I haven’t had my second coffee yet, but I’ve already merged two dependency updates into the DataAnno Fil Starter project. No fanfare, no breaking changes—just `laravel/sanctum` from 4.1.2 to 4.2.0 and `barryvdh/laravel-debugbar` from 3.15.4 to 3.16.0. On the surface, they look like routine maintenance. But dig a little deeper, and these updates are quietly strengthening both security and developer experience in meaningful ways.

I’m not one to treat composer.json like a minefield. But I also don’t treat dependency updates as noise. These two commits—small as they are—represent a habit I’ve come to rely on: proactive hygiene. Not because the app was broken, but because waiting for breakage is how tech debt accumulates.

Let’s unpack why these matter.

## Sanctum 4.2.0: Silent Security Upgrades You Shouldn’t Ignore

The jump from Sanctum 4.1.2 to 4.2.0 isn’t flashy. No new APIs. No config file overhauls. But if you scan the changelog, you’ll spot subtle but important fixes around token lifecycle management—specifically around token revocation and expiration handling.

One fix that stood out: improved cleanup of expired API tokens during session termination. Before, under certain edge cases (like concurrent requests or abrupt client disconnects), expired tokens could linger in the database longer than intended. It’s not a critical vulnerability, but it’s a soft target for abuse at scale—especially in API-heavy apps like DataAnno Fil Starter, where we’re issuing short-lived tokens for granular access.

Sanctum 4.2.0 tightens that up. It ensures tokens are invalidated more predictably and consistently, reducing the window for replay attacks and cleanup gaps. That’s not just "nice to have"—it’s foundational hygiene for any Laravel app exposing APIs.

And because DataAnno Fil Starter is designed as a secure starting point for data annotation tools (think: user roles, API access, file permissions), getting this right from day one matters. We’re not patching holes—we’re preventing them.

This update also includes better compatibility with Laravel’s upcoming first-party Sanctum improvements, so we’re not just fixing the present—we’re future-proofing a bit too.

## Debugbar 3.16.0: Smarter Local Debugging, Less Guesswork

Now, let’s talk about the dev experience.

Debugbar hasn’t changed much in appearance, but version 3.16.0 brings meaningful under-the-hood improvements—especially around query logging and request timing. The bump from 3.15.4 included updates to its collector logic, making it more accurate when tracking slow queries and duplicate Eloquent calls.

In DataAnno Fil Starter, we’re already dealing with complex relationships—users, projects, annotations, permissions. During early development, it’s easy to accidentally N+1 a query without realizing it. Debugbar 3.16.0 flags those faster and with clearer context, including better stack traces for where duplicate queries originate.

One change I appreciate: improved handling of JSON requests in the request tab. When you’re testing API endpoints locally (which we do constantly), seeing the raw request body, headers, and response timing in one place saves minutes per debug session. Multiply that across a team, and it’s hours saved per sprint.

And yes—Debugbar is a dev dependency. It doesn’t run in production. But that doesn’t make it less important. Developer tooling *is* part of the stack. Slower debugging means slower iteration, which means delayed features and buried bugs.

By updating early, we’re ensuring that every dev who spins up this starter kit gets a smooth, insight-rich local environment from minute one.

## Small Updates, Big Habits

These two commits weren’t urgent. No CVEs. No broken builds. But that’s exactly why they matter.

Security and developer experience aren’t built in big rewrites. They’re baked in through small, consistent choices—like updating dependencies before they become problems.

In the DataAnno Fil Starter project, we’re not just building a Laravel boilerplate. We’re modeling the habits we want teams to adopt: staying current, paying attention to changelogs, and treating dev tools as first-class citizens.

So next time you’re tempted to defer a minor dependency bump, ask: what invisible improvement am I delaying? Maybe it’s a tighter token cleanup. Maybe it’s a faster debug cycle. Either way, the cost of waiting is higher than you think.

I’ll take that second coffee now.
