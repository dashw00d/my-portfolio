## Diagnosing the Layout Chaos

AustinsElite (Legacy) was a PHP monolith built on a custom framework with a handful of Laravel packages—no Laravel 12, no modern frontend stack. Its Blade templates had been patched for years, resulting in a tangle of hardcoded styles, inconsistent grid systems, and zero mobile-first thinking. Buttons overflowed containers on mobile, tables became unreadable, and forms broke at arbitrary breakpoints. The CSS was a mix of inline styles, old Bootstrap classes, and custom overrides that fought each other.

My first move? Audit the most critical user paths: the dashboard, data tables, and form-heavy admin pages. Using Chrome DevTools, I mapped where layouts collapsed. The root issue wasn’t just broken CSS—it was structural. Templates were duplicating markup across pages, with no component reuse. A single table header might be copy-pasted five times, each with slight variations. Any fix had to start with abstraction, not just style tweaks.

## Restructuring with Tailwind’s Responsive Toolkit

We already had TailwindCSS in the stack, but it was underutilized—mostly used for quick utility patches instead of a full design system. I updated `tailwind.config.js` to enforce mobile-first breakpoints and standardized grid behavior:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./resources/views/**/*.blade.php"],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        sm: '640px',
        md: '768px',
        lg: '1024px',
        xl: '1280px',
      },
      gridTemplateColumns: {
        'form': 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr))',
      }
    },
  },
}
```

This let me rebuild forms and data grids using `grid` and `flex` utilities with responsive prefixes. For example, a broken two-column form became:

```blade
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
  @include('partials.form-field', ['label' => 'Name', 'type' => 'text'])
  @include('partials.form-field', ['label' => 'Email', 'type' => 'email'])
</div>
```

No more floats or `width: 300px` hacks. The layout now adapts cleanly from mobile up. Tables were trickier—instead of hiding columns on small screens (a common cop-out), I used Tailwind’s `hidden` and `block` classes with `sm:table-cell` to selectively show critical data, preserving usability.

## Building Reusable, Scoped Blade Components

The real win came from replacing `@include` spaghetti with true Blade components. Laravel’s component system was already available, but never adopted. I started small: a `<x-button>` and `<x-input>` that encapsulated consistent styling and responsive behavior.

```blade
<!-- resources/views/components/button.blade.php -->
@props(['type' => 'button', 'variant' => 'primary'])

<button
  type="{{ $type }}"
  {{ $attributes->merge(['class' => "
    px-4 py-2 rounded font-medium text-sm
    " . match($variant) {
        'primary' => 'bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 text-white',
        'secondary' => 'bg-gray-200 hover:bg-gray-300 text-gray-800',
        default => 'bg-gray-600 text-white'
    }
  "]) }}
>
  {{ $slot }}
</button>
```

Suddenly, every button followed the same visual language and responded predictably across devices. I applied the same pattern to tables (`<x-table>`, `<x-table.header>`), icons (wrapping SVGs with consistent sizing), and form groups. By using `@props` and the `$attributes->merge()` pattern, I preserved flexibility without sacrificing consistency.

For CSS isolation, I embraced Tailwind’s functional approach—no component-scoped CSS files needed. Instead, I enforced consistency through utility patterns and documented conventions in the team’s README. If a component needed unique styles, I used `@apply` sparingly in dedicated CSS files, keeping the footprint minimal.

## Validating Gains Across Devices and Developers

After refactoring key templates, I tested across real devices and browser emulators. The dashboard, once a horizontal scroll trap on mobile, now flowed cleanly at every breakpoint. Forms reflowed into single columns, tables became scrollable containers with sticky headers, and buttons stayed tappable.

But the bigger win was maintainability. What used to take 20 minutes to debug and patch—like aligning a new form field—now took seconds. New developers could drop in a `<x-input>` and trust it just worked. Technical debt didn’t vanish, but it stopped spreading.

This wasn’t a full rewrite. It was targeted, pragmatic modernization—using Tailwind and Blade components to bring order to legacy chaos. If you’re stuck in a similar PHP/Laravel frontend swamp, start small: pick one broken template, rebuild it with mobile-first Tailwind, then extract a component. Repeat. The spaghetti won’t untangle overnight, but you’ll feel the difference by day two.
